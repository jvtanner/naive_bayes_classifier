# naive bayes and logistic regression models

Data: 


Simple (simple-train.txt, simple-test.txt) 

This is a simple dataset provided primarily to help you determine that your code is working correctly. There are two input features, and the output class value is determined by the value of the first feature (i.e., y = x1). The training dataset and testing dataset are identical, each containing four data vectors. Both your Naïve Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression implementations should be able to classify all instances in the simple testing dataset with 100% accuracy after training on the simple training set.


Heart tomography diagnosis (heart-train.txt, heart-test.txt) 

This dataset contains data related to diagnosing heart abnormalities based on tomography (X-ray) information. Each input vector represents data extracted from the X-ray of one patient’s heart. There are 22 binary input features. The output class value represents the diagnosis of the patient’s heart (normal or abnormal, encoded in binary). The training dataset contains 80 data vectors, and the testing dataset contains 187 data vectors.


Genetic ancestry (ancestry-train.txt, ancestry-test.txt) 

This dataset contains DNA nucleotide readings from 467 individuals. Each input vector represents locations in the human genome and whether the individual’s nucleotide at given locations matches the human reference genome. The output class value represents the super population of the user. 


Netflix dataset (netflix-train.txt, netflix-test.txt) 

This dataset contains real user ratings from Netflix. Each input vector represents ratings by a single user for the 30 most commonly rated movies (1 = rating of 5). The output class value represents whether the user rated the target movie (Love Actually) as a 5.
